# Etch-A-Sketch

A browser-based Etch-A-Sketch application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Path.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project allows users to create a customizable grid where each cell can change color when hovered over. The app demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic grid generation.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Grid**: Users can specify the number of rows and columns for the grid.
- **Interactive Cells**: Hovering over a cell changes its color randomly.
- **Clear Grid**: Reset the grid without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid adjusts to fit the container.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure.
- **CSS3**: Grid layout, styling, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: DOM manipulation, event listeners, and dynamic element creation.

## 🚀 Getting Started
