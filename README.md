A **dynamic Etch-A-Sketch grid drawing project** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
as part of **The Odin Project – Foundations Path**.

This project allows users to create a customizable grid and draw by hovering over cells. The project reinforces DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive UI development.
